# mathtrainer_bot

Simple bot coded in python 3 to rank top 5 in the mathtrainer.org leaderboard.

Uses selenium for the webscraping and automation.

I hid the password of my mathtrainer and google accounts in this version for obvious reasons.

It took 5mins to get to number 1 in the leaderboard --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTncgwCHsTY
