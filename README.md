# mathtrainer_bot

Simple bot coded in python 3 to rank first place in the mathtrainer.org leaderboard.

Used selenium for the webscraping and automation.

I hid the password of my mathtrainer and google accounts in this version for obvious reasons.

It only took 5mins to achieve the goal --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTncgwCHsTY
